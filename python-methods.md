## 1. String Methods

Strings are used to represent text. These methods help you manipulate and query string data.

### `str.upper()` and `str.lower()`
Convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.

**Why It's Used:**
Useful for case-insensitive comparisons. For example, when checking user input (`'yes'`, `'Yes'`, `'YES'`), you can convert it to lowercase first to handle all variations with one check.

**Code:**
```python
text = "Hello World"
print(text.upper())
print(text.lower())
```

**Output:**
```
HELLO WORLD
hello world
```

### `str.strip()`
Removes leading and trailing whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).

**Why It's Used:**
Cleans up user input from forms or files where extra spaces are common but not desired.

**Code:**
```python
text = "   some whitespace   "
print(f"'{text.strip()}'")
```

**Output:**
```
'some whitespace'
```

### `str.split(separator)`
Splits a string into a list of substrings based on a separator.

**Why It's Used:**
Perfect for parsing structured data, like splitting a comma-separated string (CSV) into individual values or breaking a sentence into words.

**Code:**
```python
csv_data = "name,age,city"
items = csv_data.split(',')
print(items)
```

**Output:**
```
['name', 'age', 'city']
```

### `separator.join(list_of_strings)`
Joins elements of a list into a single string, separated by the string the method is called on.

**Why It's Used:**
Constructs a string from a list of words or data points, often used to create formatted output or file content.

**Code:**
```python
words = ["Python", "is", "awesome"]
sentence = " ".join(words)
print(sentence)
```

**Output:**
```
Python is awesome
```

### `str.replace(old, new)`
Replaces all occurrences of a substring with another.

**Why It's Used:**
Ideal for find-and-replace operations, like correcting a typo, changing a placeholder, or formatting data.

**Code:**
```python
greeting = "Hello, world!"
new_greeting = greeting.replace("world", "Python")
print(new_greeting)
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, Python!
```

### `str.find(substring)`
Returns the starting index of the first occurrence of a substring. Returns -1 if not found.

**Why It's Used:**
Checks for the existence and location of a substring. Unlike `index()`, it doesn't raise an error if the substring isn't found, making it safer for simple checks.

**Code:**
```python
text = "the quick brown fox"
print(text.find("brown"))
print(text.find("dog"))
```

**Output:**
```
10
-1
```

## 2. List Methods

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items.

### `list.append(item)`
Adds an item to the end of the list.

**Why It's Used:**
Dynamically builds a list by adding items one by one, such as collecting results from a loop or gathering user inputs.

**Code:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.append(4)
print(numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### `list.pop(index)`
Removes and returns the item at a given index. If no index is specified, it removes the last item.

**Why It's Used:**
Processes items from a list while also removing them, useful in algorithms where you handle items one at a time, like in a stack (LIFO - Last-In, First-Out).

**Code:**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
last_item = numbers.pop()
print(f"Popped item: {last_item}")
print(f"List after pop: {numbers}")
```

**Output:**
```
Popped item: 4
List after pop: [1, 2, 3]
```

### `list.sort()`
Sorts the list in place.

**Why It's Used:**
Organizes data for easier analysis or presentation, such as sorting a list of scores from lowest to highest.

**Code:**
```python
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
numbers.sort()
print(numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9]
```

### `list.index(item)`
Returns the index of the first occurrence of an item.

**Why It's Used:**
Finds the position of a specific item in a list, which is useful when you need to know *where* an item is located.

**Code:**
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(fruits.index("banana"))
```

**Output:**
```
1
```

## 3. Dictionary Methods

Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. They are unordered (in older Python versions) but are insertion-ordered in Python 3.7+.

### `dict.keys()`
Returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.

**Why It's Used:**
Allows you to iterate over just the keys of a dictionary, for example, to get all user IDs or setting names.

**Code:**
```python
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(user.keys())
```

**Output:**
```
dict_keys(['name', 'age'])
```

### `dict.values()`
Returns a view object that displays a list of all the values.

**Why It's Used:**
Lets you work with only the values, such as calculating the sum or average of all numerical values in a dictionary.

**Code:**
```python
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(user.values())
```

**Output:**
```
dict_values(['Alice', 30])
```

### `dict.items()`
Returns a view object of key-value tuple pairs.

**Why It's Used:**
This is the most common way to loop through a dictionary when you need both the key and the value at the same time.

**Code:**
```python
user = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(user.items())
```

**Output:**
```
dict_items([('name', 'Alice'), ('age', 30)])
```

### `dict.get(key, default_value)`
Safely gets a value by its key. If the key does not exist, it returns `None` or a specified default value, avoiding an error.

**Why It's Used:**
Prevents your program from crashing when you're not sure if a key exists. It's essential for handling optional data or configuration.

**Code:**
```python
user = {"name": "Alice"}
print(user.get("age"))
print(user.get("age", 25)) # Providing a default
```

**Output:**
```
None
25
```

## 4. Set Methods

Sets are unordered collections of unique items. They are useful for membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries.

### `set.add(item)`
Adds an element to the set.

**Why It's Used:**
Builds a collection of unique items. Since sets automatically handle duplicates, you can add items without checking if they're already present.

**Code:**
```python
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}
unique_numbers.add(3) # Does nothing, as 3 is already there
unique_numbers.add(4)
print(unique_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
{1, 2, 3, 4}
```

### Set Operations
Sets are powerful for mathematical operations like union, intersection, and difference.

**Why It's Used:**
- **Union (`|`)**: To get all unique items from two different collections.
- **Intersection (`&`)**: To find common items between two collections (e.g., users who are in two different groups).
- **Difference (`-`)**: To find items that are in one collection but not another (e.g., tasks in 'to-do' but not in 'completed').

**Code:**
```python
set_a = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_b = {3, 4, 5, 6}

# Union: all unique elements from both sets
print(f"Union: {set_a | set_b}")

# Intersection: elements that are in both sets
print(f"Intersection: {set_a & set_b}")

# Difference: elements in set_a but not in set_b
print(f"Difference: {set_a - set_b}")
```

**Output:**
```
Union: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
Intersection: {3, 4}
Difference: {1, 2}
```

## 5. Essential Built-in Functions

These aren't methods (you don't call them with a `.`), but they are critical for problem-solving.

### `len(item)`
Returns the number of items in an object (length of a string, number of items in a list or dictionary).

**Why It's Used:**
Frequently used in loops and conditional logic to check if a collection is empty or to iterate a specific number of times.

**Code:**
```python
print(len("hello"))
print(len([1, 2, 3, 4]))
```

**Output:**
```
5
4
```

### `range(start, stop, step)`
Generates a sequence of numbers, which is useful for loops.

**Why It's Used:**
The standard way to create a loop that runs a fixed number of times.

**Code:**
```python
for i in range(5): # from 0 up to (but not including) 5
    print(i, end=" ")
```

**Output:**
```
0 1 2 3 4 
```

### `sorted(iterable)`
Returns a new sorted list from the items in an iterable.

**Why It's Used:**
Provides a sorted version of a collection without modifying the original, which is useful when you need to preserve the original order for other parts of your program.

**Code:**
```python
numbers = (3, 1, 4, 1, 5) # A tuple
sorted_numbers = sorted(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)
```

**Output:**
```
[1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
```
