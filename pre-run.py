#     "students": {
#         "Alice": {
#             "age": 20,
#             "grades": {"Math": 90, "Physics": 85},

# }

# # Practice: Try to print the following
# # 1. Alice's age
# # 2. Bob's Biology grade
# # 3. Mrs. Smith's room number
# # 4. All clubs Alice is in
# # 5. The subject Mr. Lee teaches

# # Example:
# print(school["students"]["Alice"]["age"])  # Should print 20
# # Add your own print statements below to practice!
# def get_grade(name: str):
#     student = school.get('students')[name].get('grades')
#     for subject, grade in student.items():
#         student_grade = f"{name}'s grades are: {subject}: {grade}"
#     print(student_grade)
    
# get_grade("Bob")
