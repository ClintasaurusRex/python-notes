# Write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

# Assign values to three variables name, age, and city in a single line. Set name to "Alice", age to 30, and city to "New York".
# Assign the value 100 to three variables x, y, and z in a single line.
# Create a list named colors containing the values "red", "green", and "blue". Assign these values to three variables color1, color2, and color3 in a single line.

name, age, city = "Alice", 30, "New York"
x = y = z = 100
colors = ["red", "green", "blue"]
color1, color2, color3 = colors

print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, City: {city}")
print(f"x: {x}, y: {y}, z: {z}")
print(f"Colors: {color1}, {color2}, {color3}")
