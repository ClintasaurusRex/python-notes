## 1. Sum of Digits

### Solution 1

```python
def sum_of_digits(num):
    total = 0
    for digit in str(num):
        total += int(digit)
    print(total)
```

**Why?**

- Numbers like `123` are stored as a single value in Python.
- If you want to work with each digit (`1`, `2`, `3`), you need a way to separate them.
- When you convert the number to a string (`str(123)` becomes `'123'`), each digit becomes a character in the string.
- You can then loop through the string and process each digit individually.
- `int(digit)` converts the character back to an integer so you can add it to the total.

---

### Solution 2 (List Comprehension)

```python
def sum_of_digits(num):
    split = sum(int(d) for d in str(num))
    print(split)
```

**Why?**

- This uses a generator expression: `int(d) for d in str(num)` creates each digit as an integer.
- `sum(...)` adds up all those digits.
- This is a more concise way to do the same thing as the first solution.

**Example Usage:**

```python
sum_of_digits(123)  # Output: 6
```

---

## 2. Looping with Range (Commented Example)

```python
for i in range(20, 9, -2):
    print(i)
```

**Why?**

- `range(20, 9, -2)` starts at 20, stops before 9, and steps down by 2 each time.
- This would print: 20, 18, 16, 14, 12, 10.

---

## 3. Summing User Input Numbers

```python
n = int(input())
res = 0
print('-------------------------------------------')
for i in range(n):
    a = int(input())
    res += a
print(res)
```

**Why?**

- Asks the user how many numbers they want to sum (`n`).
- Loops `n` times, each time asking for a number and adding it to `res`.
- Prints the total sum at the end.

---

## 4. Sum Numbers from 1 to 10,000

```python
def sum_numbers():
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, 10001):
        sum += i
    print(sum)
```

**Why?**

- Loops from 1 to 10,000 (inclusive).
- Adds each number to `sum`.
- Prints the total, which is the sum of the first 10,000 natural numbers.

---

## 5. FizzBuzz

```python
print("product sum----------------")
print("Welcome to FizzBuzz!")

def fizzbuzz(num):
    for i in range(1, num + 1):  # include 'num' itself
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 7 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        elif i % 7 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        else:
            print(i)

number = int(input())
fizzbuzz(number)
```

**Why?**

- Loops from 1 to the user’s number.
- Prints "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 7.
- Prints "Fizz" if divisible by 3, "Buzz" if divisible by 7.
- Otherwise, prints the number itself.
- Classic programming exercise for practicing conditionals and loops.

## 6. Change Element in a List

### Version 1: Replace Element at Index

```python
def change_element(lst, index, new_element):
    # Make a copy to avoid changing the original list
    modified_list = lst.copy()
    # Change the element at the given index
    modified_list[index] = new_element
    return modified_list

# Example usage:
result = change_element([1, 2, 3], 0, 9)
print(result)  # Output: [9, 2, 3]
```

**Why?**

- Copies the list so the original isn’t changed.
- Updates the element at the specified index.
- Returns the modified list.

---

### Version 2: Replace with First Element from Another List

```python
def change_element(list1, index, list2):
    modified_list1 = list1.copy()
    modified_list2 = list2.copy()
    modified_list1[index] = modified_list2[0]
    return modified_list1

# Example usage:
result = change_element([1, 2, 3], 1, [5, 6, 7])
print(result)  # Output: [1, 5, 3]
```

**Why?**

- Copies both lists to avoid changing the originals.
- Replaces the element at the given index in the first list with the **first element** from the second list.
- Returns the modified list.

---

## 7. Product of Numbers in a List

```python
def prod(lst):
    product = 1
    for num in lst:
        product *= num
    print(product)

prod([1, 2, 3])  # Output: 6
```

**What is this code doing?**

- Defines a function `prod` that takes a list of numbers as input.
- Initializes a variable `product` to 1.
- Loops through each number in the list (`for num in lst:`).
- Multiplies `product` by each number in the list (`product *= num`).
- After the loop, prints the final product.
- For the example `[1, 2, 3]`, it calculates `1 * 2 * 3 = 6` and prints `6`.

**Why do we start with 1 when finding the product?**

- If you start with 0, any number multiplied by 0 is 0, so the result would always be 0.
- 1 is the **multiplicative identity**: multiplying by 1 does not change the value of the other number.
- Starting with 1 ensures the product is correct, just like how you start with 0 when adding numbers (since 0 is the additive identity).

**Summary:**

- This function multiplies all the numbers in a list together.
- Initializing the product as 1 is essential for correct multiplication.

## 8. Reversing a List Using Slicing

```python
def reversed(lst):
    print(lst[::-1])

reversed([1, 2, 3])  # Output: [3, 2, 1]
```

**What is this code doing?**

- Defines a function `reversed` that takes a list as input.
- Uses slicing with `[::-1]` to create a new list that is the reverse of the original.
- Prints the reversed list.
- For the example `[1, 2, 3]`, it outputs `[3, 2, 1]`.

**Why does `lst[::-1]` reverse the list?**

- The slicing syntax `lst[start:stop:step]` allows you to extract parts of a list.
- When you use `[::-1]`, you are telling Python:
  - Start from the end of the list and move backwards (step is -1).
  - This creates a new list with all the elements in reverse order.
- No need for a loop or extra code—Python handles the reversal efficiently with slicing.

**Summary:**

- Slicing with `[::-1]` is a quick and Pythonic way to reverse a list.
- It works for any list, regardless of its contents or length.

# Create a program that takes two inputs: a string of numbers separated by spaces, and a prefix string. The program should split the number string into individual numbers, add the prefix to each number, then join these modified numbers back into a single string separated by spaces. Finally, print the resulting string.

```python
numbers = input()
prefix = input()

nums = numbers.split()
prefixed_nums = [prefix + num for num in nums]
result = ' '.join(prefixed_nums)
print(result)
```

## Comprehensive Guide: Adding Prefixes to Numbers

### What This Program Does

This program takes a string of space-separated numbers and adds a prefix to each number, then outputs the modified numbers as a single string.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: Getting User Input

```python
numbers = input()  # Example: "1 2 3 4"
prefix = input()   # Example: "item"
```

- First input: A string containing numbers separated by spaces
- Second input: The prefix string to add to each number

#### Step 2: Splitting the Numbers

```python
nums = numbers.split()
```

- `split()` without arguments splits on any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines)
- Converts the string into a list of individual number strings
- Example: `"1 2 3 4"` becomes `['1', '2', '3', '4']`

#### Step 3: Adding Prefixes (List Comprehension)

```python
prefixed_nums = [prefix + num for num in nums]
```

This line uses a **list comprehension** - let's break it down:

**What is a List Comprehension?**

- A concise way to create a new list by applying an operation to each item in an existing list
- Format: `[expression for item in iterable]`

**How it works here:**

- `for num in nums`: Loops through each number in the `nums` list
- `prefix + num`: For each number, concatenates (joins) the prefix with that number
- `[...]`: Creates a new list with all the prefixed numbers

**Example walkthrough:**

- `nums = ['1', '2', '3', '4']`
- `prefix = "item"`
- Loop iteration 1: `"item" + "1"` = `"item1"`
- Loop iteration 2: `"item" + "2"` = `"item2"`
- Loop iteration 3: `"item" + "3"` = `"item3"`
- Loop iteration 4: `"item" + "4"` = `"item4"`
- Result: `['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4']`

**Alternative without list comprehension:**

```python
prefixed_nums = []
for num in nums:
    prefixed_nums.append(prefix + num)
```

#### Step 4: Joining Back Into a String

```python
result = ' '.join(prefixed_nums)
```

- `join()` is a string method that combines list elements into a single string
- `' '.join()` uses a space as the separator between elements
- Example: `['item1', 'item2', 'item3', 'item4']` becomes `"item1 item2 item3 item4"`

#### Step 5: Output the Result

```python
print(result)
```

- Prints the final string with all prefixed numbers

### Complete Example Run

```python
Input 1: "10 20 30"
Input 2: "num"

Step-by-step:
1. numbers = "10 20 30"
2. prefix = "num"
3. nums = ['10', '20', '30']
4. prefixed_nums = ['num10', 'num20', 'num30']
5. result = "num10 num20 num30"
6. Output: "num10 num20 num30"
```

### Key Concepts Used

1. **String Methods:**

   - `split()`: Breaks strings into lists
   - `join()`: Combines lists into strings

2. **String Concatenation:**

   - `+` operator joins strings together
   - `"hello" + "world"` = `"helloworld"`

3. **List Comprehension:**

   - Concise way to transform lists
   - `[expression for item in list]`

4. **Data Flow:**
   - String → List → Modified List → String
   - Each step transforms the data for the next operation
