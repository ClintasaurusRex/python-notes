# Identity vs. Equality in Python: A Guide to `is` and `==`

In Python, understanding the difference between _identity_ and _equality_ is crucial for writing correct and efficient code. This guide explores the `is` and `is not` operators for checking identity, and contrasts them with the `==` and `!=` operators for checking equality.

---

## Equality (`==` and `!=`)

Equality checks compare the **values** of two objects. If the contents are the same, the `==` operator returns `True`.

### Example with Lists

```python
list_a = [1, 2, 3]
list_b = [1, 2, 3]

# Equality Check: Do they have the same content?
print(f"list_a == list_b: {list_a == list_b}")  # Output: True
```

Here, `list_a` and `list_b` contain the exact same elements in the same order, so they are considered equal.

---

## Identity (`is` and `is not`)

Identity checks determine if two variables refer to the **exact same object in memory**. It's a check of memory addresses, not content.

### Example with Lists (Continued)

```python
list_a = [1, 2, 3]
list_b = [1, 2, 3]
list_c = list_a  # list_c now points to the same object as list_a

# Identity Check: Do they refer to the same object?
print(f"list_a is list_b: {list_a is list_b}")  # Output: False
print(f"list_a is list_c: {list_a is list_c}")  # Output: True
```

- `list_a is list_b` is `False` because, although their contents are identical, they are two separate, independent objects stored in different memory locations.
- `list_a is list_c` is `True` because `list_c` was assigned to `list_a`, so they both point to the very same object. Modifying one will affect the other.

```python
# Modifying list_c also changes list_a
list_c.append(4)
print(f"list_a after change: {list_a}") # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(f"list_c after change: {list_c}") # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## When to Use Identity Checks

Identity checks are faster than equality checks because they only compare memory addresses. They are most useful in specific scenarios.

### 1. Checking for `None`

The most common and recommended use of `is` is to check if a variable is `None`. `None` is a singleton object in Python (there's only ever one instance of it), so you should always use `is` or `is not`.

```python
my_variable = None

# Correct way to check for None
if my_variable is None:
    print("The variable is None.")

# Incorrect, but might work
if my_variable == None:
    print("This also works, but is not the Pythonic way.")
```

**Why `is` is preferred for `None`**: It's faster and safer. A custom object could technically override the `==` operator to behave unexpectedly when compared to `None`. The `is` operator cannot be overridden and guarantees an identity check.

### 2. Working with Integers and Strings (Caching)

For performance reasons, Python pre-allocates and caches small integers (usually from -5 to 256) and short strings. Variables pointing to these values will often share the same memory address.

```python
a = 256
b = 256
print(f"a is b: {a is b}") # Output: True (usually)

x = 257
y = 257
print(f"x is y: {x is y}") # Output: False (usually)

str1 = "hello"
str2 = "hello"
print(f"str1 is str2: {str1 is str2}") # Output: True (usually, due to string interning)
```

**Warning**: You should **not** rely on this behavior. It's an implementation detail of CPython and can change. For comparing values, always use `==`.

## Practical Scenario: Dictionaries and Shared References

Imagine you have a default configuration dictionary that you want to apply to multiple settings.

```python
default_config = {'retries': 3, 'timeout': 60}

# Incorrectly copying the reference
config1 = default_config
config2 = default_config

print(f"config1 is default_config: {config1 is default_config}") # True

# If we change config1, we unintentionally change the default and config2!
config1['timeout'] = 90

print(f"config1: {config1}")
print(f"config2: {config2}")
print(f"default_config: {default_config}")
# Output for all three: {'retries': 3, 'timeout': 90}
```

To avoid this, you must create a _copy_ of the dictionary, ensuring they are different objects.

```python
default_config = {'retries': 3, 'timeout': 60}

# Correctly creating copies
config1 = default_config.copy()
config2 = default_config.copy()

print(f"config1 is default_config: {config1 is default_config}") # False
print(f"config1 == default_config: {config1 == default_config}") # True

# Now, changing config1 does not affect the others
config1['timeout'] = 90

print(f"config1: {config1}") # {'retries': 3, 'timeout': 90}
print(f"default_config: {default_config}") # {'retries': 3, 'timeout': 60}
```

## Summary

| Operator | Checks...                         | Use Case                                                |
| :------- | :-------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `==`     | **Equality** (Value)              | Comparing the contents of two objects.                  |
| `is`     | **Identity** (Memory Address)     | Checking if two variables point to the same object.     |
| `!=`     | **Inequality** (Value)            | Comparing if the contents of two objects are different. |
| `is not` | **Non-identity** (Memory Address) | Checking if two variables point to different objects.   |

- Use `==` when you care about what an object **contains**.
- Use `is` when you care about whether you're dealing with the **exact same object**.
- **Always** use `is` or `is not` when checking for `None`.

```python
# More identity check examples:
list3 = [1,2,3]
print('list1 is list2:', list1 is list2)  # True, same object
print('list1 is list3:', list1 is list3)  # False, different objects with same values
print('list1 == list3:', list1 == list3)  # True, values are equal

# Identity with integers (small numbers are cached)
x = 5
y = 5
z = 1000
w = 1000
print('x is y:', x is y)  # True, small integers are cached
print('z is w:', z is w)  # May be False, large integers may not be cached

# Identity with strings (sometimes cached)
s1 = 'hello'
s2 = 'hello'
s3 = ''.join(['he', 'llo'])
print('s1 is s2:', s1 is s2)  # True, string literals are often cached
print('s1 is s3:', s1 is s3)  # May be False, s3 is built at runtime

print(i)
```
