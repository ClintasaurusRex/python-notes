## Introduction

Lists are one of the most versatile and widely used data structures in Python. They allow you to store collections of items, which can be of any type. This guide covers the essential operations, built-in methods, and handy functions for working with lists in Python.

---

## Creating a List

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
empty_list = []
mixed = [1, "hello", 3.14, True]
```

---

## Accessing Elements

- **By Index:**
  ```python
  print(fruits[0])  # 'apple'
  print(fruits[-1]) # 'cherry' (last element)
  ```
- **Slicing:**
  ```python
  print(fruits[1:3])  # ['banana', 'cherry']
  print(fruits[:2])   # ['apple', 'banana']
  print(fruits[::2])  # ['apple', 'cherry']
  ```

---

## Modifying Elements

```python
fruits[1] = "blueberry"  # ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry']
```

---

## Adding Elements

- **append()**: Adds a single element to the end of the list.
  ```python
  fruits.append("orange")
  ```
- **insert()**: Inserts an element at a specified index.
  ```python
  fruits.insert(1, "kiwi")
  ```
- **extend()**: Adds all elements from another iterable (like a list) to the end of the list.
  ```python
  fruits.extend(["mango", "grape"])
  ```

---

## Removing Elements

- **del**: Deletes an element at a specific index.
  ```python
  del fruits[0]
  ```
- **pop()**: Removes and returns the element at the given index (last by default).
  ```python
  last = fruits.pop()
  first = fruits.pop(0)
  ```
- **remove()**: Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
  ```python
  fruits.remove("banana")
  ```
- **clear()**: Removes all elements from the list, leaving it empty.
  ```python
  fruits.clear()
  ```

---

## Looping Over Lists

You can process each item in a list using a `for` loop.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

_This is the most common way to access each element in a list._

---

## Using range() with Lists

The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers, often used for looping a specific number of times or accessing list indices.

```python
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(i, fruits[i])
```

_Use `range()` when you need the index as well as the value._

---

## Enumerate and Indexing

The `enumerate()` function is useful when you need both the index (position) and the value from a list while looping. Instead of manually keeping track of the index with a counter, `enumerate()` automatically provides it for you.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"Index {index}: {fruit}")
```

_Use `enumerate()` whenever you need both the index and the value in a loop._

---

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists based on existing lists or other iterables. They are a powerful feature that allows you to create lists in a more readable and efficient way.

### What is List Comprehension?

Think of list comprehension as a **shortcut for creating lists**. It's like having a factory that takes items, applies some rules, and spits out a new list.

**Basic Syntax**: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

### Understanding the Pattern

```python
[what_to_put_in_new_list for item in old_list if condition]
```

**Read it like English (right to left):**

- `for item in old_list` = "Go through each item in the old list"
- `if condition` = "But only if the condition is true"
- `what_to_put_in_new_list` (at the beginning) = "Take that item and put it in the new list"

### The Long Way vs. List Comprehension

#### Without List Comprehension (The Traditional Way):

```python
# Create a list of squares
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = []  # Start with empty list
for number in numbers:  # Go through each number
    square = number ** 2  # Calculate square
    squares.append(square)  # Add to new list
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

#### With List Comprehension (The Pythonic Way):

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squares = [number**2 for number in numbers]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

**They do exactly the same thing!**

### Basic Examples

```python
# Basic transformation
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = [x**2 for x in numbers]
print(squares)  # [1, 4, 9, 16]

# Filtering items
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # [2, 4, 6]

# Transforming and filtering together
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
squared_evens = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(squared_evens)  # [4, 16, 36]

# String manipulation
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
upper_words = [word.upper() for word in words]
print(upper_words)  # ['HELLO', 'WORLD', 'PYTHON']

# Working with ranges
even_numbers = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

### Think of it Like a Filter and Transform

Imagine you have a box of items and you want to:

1. **Filter:** Only keep certain items (the `if` condition)
2. **Transform:** Change each item somehow (the expression)
3. **Collect:** Put the results in a new box (the new list)

```python
# Example: Get lengths of words that start with 'p'
words = ["python", "java", "programming", "code", "perl"]
p_word_lengths = [len(word) for word in words if word.startswith('p')]
print(p_word_lengths)  # [6, 11, 4]
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

Let's break down this example: `[friend for friend in list2 if friend not in list1]`

```python
list1 = ["John", "Emma", "Mike", "Sarah"]
list2 = ["Emma", "Tom", "Sarah", "Peter"]

# What happens step by step:
# 1. Check "Emma" → Is "Emma" not in list1? No, it IS in list1 → Skip
# 2. Check "Tom" → Is "Tom" not in list1? Yes → Add "Tom"
# 3. Check "Sarah" → Is "Sarah" not in list1? No, it IS in list1 → Skip
# 4. Check "Peter" → Is "Peter" not in list1? Yes → Add "Peter"

only_in_list2 = [friend for friend in list2 if friend not in list1]
print(only_in_list2)  # ["Tom", "Peter"]
```

### More Practical Examples

#### Example 1: Filter and Transform Numbers

```python
# Get all numbers that are divisible by 3, but squared
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]

# Long way
result = []
for num in numbers:
    if num % 3 == 0:
        result.append(num ** 2)

# Short way (list comprehension)
result = [num**2 for num in numbers if num % 3 == 0]
print(result)  # [9, 36, 81, 144]
```

#### Example 2: Working with Strings

```python
# Get first letter of each word, but only for words longer than 3 characters
words = ["cat", "elephant", "dog", "butterfly", "ant"]

# Long way
first_letters = []
for word in words:
    if len(word) > 3:
        first_letters.append(word[0].upper())

# Short way
first_letters = [word[0].upper() for word in words if len(word) > 3]
print(first_letters)  # ['E', 'B']
```

#### Example 3: Converting Data Types

```python
# Convert string numbers to integers, but only if they're actually numbers
mixed_data = ["1", "hello", "2", "world", "3", "42"]

# Long way
numbers = []
for item in mixed_data:
    if item.isdigit():
        numbers.append(int(item))

# Short way
numbers = [int(item) for item in mixed_data if item.isdigit()]
print(numbers)  # [1, 2, 3, 42]
```

### Advanced Techniques

#### Nested Loops

```python
# Traditional nested loops
matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
flattened = []
for row in matrix:
    for num in row:
        flattened.append(num)

# List comprehension with nested loops
flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]
print(flattened)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

#### Complex Expressions

```python
# Create coordinate pairs, but exclude where x equals y
coords = [(x, y) for x in range(3) for y in range(3) if x != y]
print(coords)  # [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]

# Multiple conditions
numbers = range(1, 21)
special = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0 and x % 3 == 0]
print(special)  # [6, 12, 18] - divisible by both 2 and 3
```

### When to Use List Comprehensions

#### ✅ **Good Use Cases:**

- Simple transformations: `[x * 2 for x in numbers]`
- Filtering with simple conditions: `[x for x in words if len(x) > 5]`
- Converting data types: `[int(x) for x in string_numbers]`

#### ❌ **When NOT to Use:**

- Complex logic that requires multiple lines
- When it becomes hard to read
- When you need to handle exceptions

### Summary: The Three Parts

Remember, every list comprehension has up to three parts:

1. **Expression** (what to put in the new list): `x**2`
2. **Iterator** (where to get items from): `for x in numbers`
3. **Condition** (optional filter): `if x % 2 == 0`

**Pattern:** `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

Think of it as a **recipe**: "Take each ingredient, apply this rule, put the result in a new bowl - but only if it meets this condition."

## Built-in Functions for Lists

### len()

Returns the number of items in a list.

```python
print(len(fruits))  # 3
```

### sum(), min(), max()

- **sum()**: Returns the sum of all elements (numeric lists).
- **min()**: Returns the smallest element.
- **max()**: Returns the largest element.

```python
numbers = [2, 5, 1]
print(sum(numbers))  # 8
print(min(numbers))  # 1
print(max(numbers))  # 5
```

### sorted()

Returns a new sorted list from the elements of any iterable.

```python
print(sorted(fruits))
```

### reversed()

Returns an iterator that accesses the given list in the reverse order.

```python
for fruit in reversed(fruits):
    print(fruit)
```

### set()

Converts a list into a set, removing any duplicate values. Useful for getting unique elements.

```python
numbers = [4, 2, 7, 4, 2, 9, 1]
unique_numbers = list(set(numbers))
print(unique_numbers)  # Output might be [1, 2, 4, 7, 9] (order not guaranteed)
# To get a sorted list of unique values:
unique_sorted = sorted(set(numbers))
print(unique_sorted)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]
```

_The `set()` function is a quick and easy way to remove duplicates from a list. Combine it with `sorted()` if you need the result in order._

### any()

Returns `True` if at least one element in the list is `True` (or truthy).

```python
numbers = [0, 0, 3, 0]
print(any(numbers))  # Output: True
```

### all()

Returns `True` if all elements in the list are `True` (or truthy).

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
print(all(numbers))  # Output: True
numbers = [1, 0, 3]
print(all(numbers))  # Output: False
```

### zip()

Combines two or more lists into tuples, element-wise. Useful for parallel iteration.

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
scores = [85, 92, 78]
for name, score in zip(names, scores):
    print(f"{name}: {score}")
# Output:
# Alice: 85
# Bob: 92
# Charlie: 78
```

### map()

Applies a function to every item in a list and returns an iterator. Convert to a list to see the results.

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
squares = list(map(square, numbers))
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16]
```

### filter()

Filters items in a list based on a function that returns `True` or `False`.

```python
def is_even(x):
    return x % 2 == 0
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
evens = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### list()

Converts other iterables (like tuples or strings) into a list.

```python
tuple_data = (1, 2, 3)
list_data = list(tuple_data)
print(list_data)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
