## Example: List Comprehension with Filtering

### 📝 The Code
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)
```

### 🎯 What This Does
Creates a new list containing the squares of only the even numbers from the original list.

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Line 1: Setting Up Our Data
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
- **What's happening:** We're creating a list of numbers from 1 to 10
- **Think of it like:** Setting up a row of numbered boxes on a table

#### Line 2: The List Comprehension (The Magic!)
```python
even_squares = [x**2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
```

Let's break this down into chunks:

##### Part 1: `x**2` (The Transformation)
- **What it does:** Takes each number and squares it (multiplies by itself)
- **Think of it like:** A machine that takes a number and makes it bigger by multiplying it by itself
- **Example:** 4 becomes 4 × 4 = 16

##### Part 2: `for x in numbers` (The Loop)
- **What it does:** Goes through each item in our `numbers` list, one by one
- **Think of it like:** Walking down the row of boxes, picking up each number
- **`x` is just a name:** We could call it `num` or `item` - it's just a temporary holder

##### Part 3: `if x % 2 == 0` (The Filter)
- **What it does:** Only keeps numbers that are even (divisible by 2)
- **`%` is the modulo operator:** It gives you the remainder after division
- **`x % 2 == 0` means:** "When you divide this number by 2, is there no remainder?"
- **Think of it like:** A bouncer at a club who only lets even numbers in

### 🎬 The Process in Action

Imagine this happening step by step:

1. **Start with:** [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

2. **For each number, ask:** "Is this even?"
   - 1: 1 ÷ 2 = 0 remainder **1** → ❌ Not even, skip it
   - 2: 2 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder **0** → ✅ Even! Keep it
   - 3: 3 ÷ 2 = 1 remainder **1** → ❌ Not even, skip it
   - 4: 4 ÷ 2 = 2 remainder **0** → ✅ Even! Keep it
   - (and so on...)

3. **Even numbers found:** [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

4. **Square each even number:**
   - 2² = 4
   - 4² = 16
   - 6² = 36
   - 8² = 64
   - 10² = 100

5. **Final result:** [4, 16, 36, 64, 100]

### 💡 Mental Model
Think of list comprehensions like a factory assembly line:
- **Input conveyor belt:** Your original list
- **Filter station:** The `if` condition (only certain items pass through)
- **Transformation machine:** The expression before `for` (changes each item)
- **Output bin:** Your new list

### 🔄 Alternative Without List Comprehension
To help understand what's happening, here's the same logic written the long way:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
even_squares = []  # Start with empty list

for x in numbers:          # Go through each number
    if x % 2 == 0:         # Check if it's even
        squared = x**2     # Square it
        even_squares.append(squared)  # Add to our result list

print(even_squares)
```

### 🎯 Key Takeaways
- **List comprehensions are shortcuts:** They pack a lot of logic into one line
- **Three parts:** transformation, loop, and optional filter
- **Read from left to right:** "Give me [this thing] for [each item] if [condition is true]"
- **Visual pattern:** `[WHAT_TO_DO for ITEM in LIST if CONDITION]`

### 🧪 Try This Yourself
Change the code to experiment:
```python
# Try these variations:
odd_cubes = [x**3 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 1]  # Cubes of odd numbers
big_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x > 5]        # Numbers greater than 5
doubled_evens = [x*2 for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]  # Double the even numbers
```

## 📚 Notes for Future Me
- List comprehensions can feel confusing at first - that's normal!
- Always read them left to right: WHAT, HOW, WHEN
- If it gets too complex, write it as a regular loop first, then convert
- The `%` operator is super useful for checking divisibility
