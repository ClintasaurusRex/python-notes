## Introduction

**What are loops?**
Loops are fundamental programming constructs that allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly. Instead of writing the same code multiple times, loops provide a way to automate repetitive tasks efficiently.

**Why are loops important?**

- **Efficiency**: Reduce code duplication and make programs more maintainable
- **Automation**: Process large amounts of data or perform repetitive tasks
- **Flexibility**: Handle varying amounts of data dynamically
- **Scalability**: Write programs that can work with datasets of any size

**Types of loops in Python:**
Python provides two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops, each serving different purposes and use cases.

---

## The for Loop

The `for` loop is Python's most versatile and commonly used loop. It's designed to iterate over sequences (like lists, strings, tuples) or other iterable objects.

### Basic for Loop Syntax

**Structure:**

```python
for variable in iterable:
    # Code to execute for each item
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...
```

**How it works:**

1. Python takes the first item from the iterable
2. Assigns it to the variable
3. Executes the code block
4. Repeats with the next item until the iterable is exhausted

**Simple example:**

```python
# Printing each character in a string
name = "Python"
for letter in name:
    print(letter)

# Output:
# P
# y
# t
# h
# o
# n
```

### Iterating Over Different Data Types

#### Strings

**Description:** When you iterate over a string, you get each character one by one.

```python
message = "Hello"
for char in message:
    print(f"Character: {char}")

# Output:
# Character: H
# Character: e
# Character: l
# Character: l
# Character: o
```

#### Lists

**Description:** Iterating over lists gives you each element in order.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(f"I like {fruit}")

# Output:
# I like apple
# I like banana
# I like cherry
```

#### Tuples

**Description:** Similar to lists, but with immutable sequences.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20, 30)
for coordinate in coordinates:
    print(f"Position: {coordinate}")

# Output:
# Position: 10
# Position: 20
# Position: 30
```

#### Dictionaries

**Description:** By default, iterating over a dictionary gives you the keys.

```python
student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20, "grade": "A"}

# Iterating over keys (default)
for key in student:
    print(f"Key: {key}, Value: {student[key]}")

# Iterating over values
for value in student.values():
    print(f"Value: {value}")

# Iterating over key-value pairs
for key, value in student.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")

# Output:
# Key: name, Value: Alice
# Key: age, Value: 20
# Key: grade, Value: A
# Value: Alice
# Value: 20
# Value: A
# name: Alice
# age: 20
# grade: A
```

#### Sets

**Description:** Iterating over sets gives you each unique element (order not guaranteed).

```python
colors = {"red", "green", "blue"}
for color in colors:
    print(f"Color: {color}")

# Output (order may vary):
# Color: blue
# Color: green
# Color: red
```

### Using range() with for Loops

**Description:** The `range()` function generates sequences of numbers, making it perfect for creating traditional counting loops.

#### Basic range() usage:

```python
# range(stop) - from 0 to stop-1
for i in range(5):
    print(f"Number: {i}")

# Output:
# Number: 0
# Number: 1
# Number: 2
# Number: 3
# Number: 4
```

#### range() with start and stop:

```python
# range(start, stop) - from start to stop-1
for i in range(2, 8):
    print(f"Number: {i}")

# Output:
# Number: 2
# Number: 3
# Number: 4
# Number: 5
# Number: 6
# Number: 7
```

#### range() with step:

```python
# range(start, stop, step) - from start to stop-1, incrementing by step
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(f"Even number: {i}")

# Output:
# Even number: 0
# Even number: 2
# Even number: 4
# Even number: 6
# Even number: 8

# Counting backwards
for i in range(10, 0, -1):
    print(f"Countdown: {i}")

# Output:
# Countdown: 10
# Countdown: 9
# ...
# Countdown: 1
```

#### Practical range() examples:

```python
# Creating a multiplication table
number = 5
for i in range(1, 11):
    result = number * i
    print(f"{number} × {i} = {result}")

# Processing list indices
items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(items)):
    print(f"Index {i}: {items[i]}")
```

### Nested for Loops

**Description:** Loops inside other loops, useful for processing multi-dimensional data or creating combinations.

#### Basic nested loop:

```python
# Creating a multiplication table
for i in range(1, 4):
    for j in range(1, 4):
        product = i * j
        print(f"{i} × {j} = {product}")
    print("---")  # Separator between rows

# Output:
# 1 × 1 = 1
# 1 × 2 = 2
# 1 × 3 = 3
# ---
# 2 × 1 = 2
# 2 × 2 = 4
# 2 × 3 = 6
# ---
# 3 × 1 = 3
# 3 × 2 = 6
# 3 × 3 = 9
# ---
```

#### Processing 2D data:

```python
# Working with a matrix (list of lists)
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for row in matrix:
    for element in row:
        print(element, end=" ")
    print()  # New line after each row

# Output:
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6
# 7 8 9
```

#### Creating combinations:

```python
# Finding all combinations of colors and sizes
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
sizes = ["small", "medium", "large"]

for color in colors:
    for size in sizes:
        print(f"{size} {color} shirt")

# Output:
# small red shirt
# medium red shirt
# large red shirt
# small blue shirt
# medium blue shirt
# large blue shirt
# small green shirt
# medium green shirt
# large green shirt
```

### for Loop with else

**Description:** Python's `for` loops can have an `else` clause that executes when the loop completes normally (not interrupted by `break`).

```python
# Searching for an item
numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
target = 4

for num in numbers:
    if num == target:
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        break
else:
    print(f"{target} not found in the list")

# Output: 4 not found in the list

# Example where item is found
target = 5
for num in numbers:
    if num == target:
        print(f"Found {target}!")
        break
else:
    print(f"{target} not found in the list")

# Output: Found 5!
```

---

## The while Loop

The `while` loop continues executing as long as a specified condition remains true. It's perfect for situations where you don't know in advance how many iterations you need.

### Basic while Loop Syntax

**Structure:**

```python
while condition:
    # Code to execute while condition is True
    statement1
    statement2
    # Make sure to modify the condition eventually!
```

**How it works:**

1. Python evaluates the condition
2. If True, executes the code block
3. Returns to step 1
4. If False, exits the loop

**Simple example:**

```python
# Counting from 1 to 5
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(f"Count: {count}")
    count += 1  # Important: modify the condition variable!

# Output:
# Count: 1
# Count: 2
# Count: 3
# Count: 4
# Count: 5
```

### Common while Loop Patterns

#### Input validation:

```python
# Keep asking for input until valid
while True:
    age = input("Enter your age (must be positive): ")
    try:
        age = int(age)
        if age > 0:
            print(f"You are {age} years old.")
            break  # Exit the loop when valid input is received
        else:
            print("Age must be positive!")
    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")
```

#### Processing until a condition is met:

```python
# Finding the first power of 2 greater than 1000
power = 1
exponent = 0

while power <= 1000:
    exponent += 1
    power = 2 ** exponent

print(f"2^{exponent} = {power} is the first power of 2 greater than 1000")

# Output: 2^10 = 1024 is the first power of 2 greater than 1000
```

#### Menu-driven programs:

```python
# Simple calculator menu
while True:
    print("\nCalculator Menu:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    print("5. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-5): ")

    if choice == "5":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    elif choice in ["1", "2", "3", "4"]:
        try:
            num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

            if choice == "1":
                result = num1 + num2
                operation = "+"
            elif choice == "2":
                result = num1 - num2
                operation = "-"
            elif choice == "3":
                result = num1 * num2
                operation = "*"
            elif choice == "4":
                if num2 != 0:
                    result = num1 / num2
                    operation = "/"
                else:
                    print("Error: Division by zero!")
                    continue

            print(f"{num1} {operation} {num2} = {result}")

        except ValueError:
            print("Error: Please enter valid numbers!")
    else:
        print("Invalid choice! Please try again.")
```

### Infinite Loops and How to Avoid Them

**What is an infinite loop?**
An infinite loop occurs when the loop condition never becomes false, causing the program to run forever.

#### Common causes:

```python
# BAD: Forgetting to update the condition variable
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    # Missing: count += 1

# BAD: Incorrect condition logic
count = 1
while count >= 1:  # This will always be true!
    print(count)
    count += 1

# BAD: Updating in wrong direction
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count -= 1  # Going backwards!
```

#### How to avoid infinite loops:

```python
# GOOD: Always ensure the condition can become false
count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # This will eventually make count > 5

# GOOD: Use a safety counter for complex conditions
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 100

while some_complex_condition() and attempts < max_attempts:
    # Do something
    attempts += 1

if attempts >= max_attempts:
    print("Warning: Maximum attempts reached!")
```

### while Loop with else

**Description:** Like `for` loops, `while` loops can also have an `else` clause.

```python
# Finding if a number is prime
number = 17
factor = 2

while factor < number:
    if number % factor == 0:
        print(f"{number} is not prime (divisible by {factor})")
        break
    factor += 1
else:
    print(f"{number} is prime!")

# Output: 17 is prime!
```

---

## Loop Control Statements

Loop control statements allow you to change the normal flow of loop execution.

### break Statement

**Description:** The `break` statement immediately exits the current loop, skipping any remaining iterations.

#### Breaking out of for loops:

```python
# Stop when we find what we're looking for
numbers = [1, 3, 7, 2, 9, 4, 6]
target = 7

for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    if num == target:
        print(f"Found {target} at position {i}")
        break
    print(f"Checking position {i}: {num}")

# Output:
# Checking position 0: 1
# Checking position 1: 3
# Found 7 at position 2
```

#### Breaking out of while loops:

```python
# Exit based on user input
while True:
    command = input("Enter a command (or 'quit' to exit): ")
    if command.lower() == 'quit':
        print("Exiting program...")
        break
    print(f"You entered: {command}")
```

#### Breaking out of nested loops:

```python
# Finding the first duplicate in a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6]
found_duplicate = False

for i in range(len(numbers)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
        if numbers[i] == numbers[j]:
            print(f"Found duplicate: {numbers[i]} at positions {i} and {j}")
            found_duplicate = True
            break
    if found_duplicate:
        break

# Output: Found duplicate: 2 at positions 1 and 4
```

### continue Statement

**Description:** The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next one.

#### Skipping specific values:

```python
# Print only odd numbers
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:  # If even
        continue    # Skip the rest and go to next iteration
    print(f"Odd number: {i}")

# Output:
# Odd number: 1
# Odd number: 3
# Odd number: 5
# Odd number: 7
# Odd number: 9
```

#### Processing valid data only:

```python
# Process only valid scores
scores = [85, -5, 92, 105, 78, -10, 88]

for score in scores:
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        print(f"Invalid score: {score} (skipping)")
        continue

    # Process valid score
    if score >= 90:
        grade = "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        grade = "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        grade = "C"
    else:
        grade = "F"

    print(f"Score: {score}, Grade: {grade}")

# Output:
# Score: 85, Grade: B
# Invalid score: -5 (skipping)
# Score: 92, Grade: A
# Invalid score: 105 (skipping)
# Score: 78, Grade: C
# Invalid score: -10 (skipping)
# Score: 88, Grade: B
```

### pass Statement

**Description:** The `pass` statement is a null operation - it does nothing when executed. It's useful as a placeholder.

```python
# Placeholder for future implementation
for i in range(5):
    if i == 2:
        pass  # TODO: Add special handling for i=2 later
    else:
        print(f"Processing {i}")

# Creating empty loops for timing or waiting
import time

print("Starting countdown...")
for i in range(3, 0, -1):
    print(f"{i}...")
    time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second
    pass  # Placeholder - could add more logic here later

print("Go!")
```

---

## Advanced Loop Techniques

### enumerate()

**Description:** The `enumerate()` function adds a counter to an iterable, returning both the index and the value.

#### Basic usage:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

# Without enumerate (manual indexing)
for i in range(len(fruits)):
    print(f"{i}: {fruits[i]}")

# With enumerate (cleaner and more Pythonic)
for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits):
    print(f"{i}: {fruit}")

# Output for both:
# 0: apple
# 1: banana
# 2: cherry
```

#### Starting from a different number:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for i, fruit in enumerate(fruits, start=1):
    print(f"{i}. {fruit}")

# Output:
# 1. apple
# 2. banana
# 3. cherry
```

#### Practical example - finding positions:

```python
text = "hello world"
vowels = "aeiou"

print("Vowel positions:")
for i, char in enumerate(text):
    if char.lower() in vowels:
        print(f"Vowel '{char}' found at position {i}")

# Output:
# Vowel positions:
# Vowel 'e' found at position 1
# Vowel 'o' found at position 4
# Vowel 'o' found at position 7
```

### zip()

**Description:** The `zip()` function combines multiple iterables, allowing you to loop over them simultaneously.

#### Basic usage:

```python
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
ages = [25, 30, 35]
cities = ["New York", "London", "Tokyo"]

for name, age, city in zip(names, ages, cities):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old and lives in {city}")

# Output:
# Alice is 25 years old and lives in New York
# Bob is 30 years old and lives in London
# Charlie is 35 years old and lives in Tokyo
```

#### Handling different lengths:

```python
# zip() stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted
list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']

for num, letter in zip(list1, list2):
    print(f"{num}: {letter}")

# Output:
# 1: a
# 2: b
# 3: c
```

#### Creating dictionaries with zip():

```python
keys = ["name", "age", "city"]
values = ["Alice", 25, "New York"]

person = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(person)

# Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

### reversed()

**Description:** The `reversed()` function returns an iterator that accesses the given sequence in reverse order.

```python
# Reversing a list
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print("Original order:")
for num in numbers:
    print(num, end=" ")

print("\nReversed order:")
for num in reversed(numbers):
    print(num, end=" ")

# Output:
# Original order:
# 1 2 3 4 5
# Reversed order:
# 5 4 3 2 1

# Reversing a string
word = "Python"
print("Reversed word:", end=" ")
for char in reversed(word):
    print(char, end="")

# Output: Reversed word: nohtyP

```

#### Reverse using the splice method

```python
def reversed(lst):
    print(lst[::-1])

reversed([1, 2, 3])  # Output: [3, 2, 1]
```

**What is this code doing?**

- Defines a function `reversed` that takes a list as input.
- Uses slicing with `[::-1]` to create a new list that is the reverse of the original.
- Prints the reversed list.
- For the example `[1, 2, 3]`, it outputs `[3, 2, 1]`.

**Why does `lst[::-1]` reverse the list?**

- The slicing syntax `lst[start:stop:step]` allows you to extract parts of a list.
- When you use `[::-1]`, you are telling Python:
  - Start from the end of the list and move backwards (step is -1).
  - This creates a new list with all the elements in reverse order.
- No need for a loop or extra code—Python handles the reversal efficiently with slicing.

````
### List Comprehensions

**Description:** List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists using a loop-like syntax.

#### Basic syntax:

```python
# Traditional approach
squares = []
for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

# List comprehension (more concise)
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print(squares)
# Output: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
````

#### With conditions:

```python
# Only even squares
even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
print(even_squares)
# Output: [0, 4, 16, 36, 64]

# Processing strings
words = ["hello", "world", "python", "programming"]
uppercase_long_words = [word.upper() for word in words if len(word) > 5]
print(uppercase_long_words)
# Output: ['PYTHON', 'PROGRAMMING']
```

#### Nested list comprehensions:

```python
# Creating a multiplication table
multiplication_table = [[i * j for j in range(1, 6)] for i in range(1, 6)]

for row in multiplication_table:
    print(row)

# Output:
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
# [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
# [4, 8, 12, 16, 20]
# [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
```

### Dictionary Comprehensions

**Description:** Similar to list comprehensions, but for creating dictionaries.

```python
# Creating a dictionary of squares
squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
print(squares_dict)
# Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}

# Filtering and transforming
words = ["hello", "world", "python"]
word_lengths = {word: len(word) for word in words if len(word) > 4}
print(word_lengths)
# Output: {'hello': 5, 'world': 5, 'python': 6}

# Swapping keys and values
original = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
swapped = {v: k for k, v in original.items()}
print(swapped)
# Output: {1: 'a', 2: 'b', 3: 'c'}
```

### Set Comprehensions

**Description:** Creating sets using comprehension syntax.

```python
# Creating a set of unique squares
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]
unique_squares = {x**2 for x in numbers}
print(unique_squares)
# Output: {1, 4, 9, 16, 25}

# Finding unique vowels in a sentence
sentence = "hello world"
unique_vowels = {char.lower() for char in sentence if char.lower() in "aeiou"}
print(unique_vowels)
# Output: {'e', 'o'}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Choosing the Right Loop Type

#### Use for loops when:

- You know the number of iterations in advance
- You're iterating over a sequence or collection
- You need the index along with the value (use `enumerate()`)

```python
# Good: Iterating over known data
for item in my_list:
    process(item)

# Good: Fixed number of iterations
for i in range(100):
    do_something()
```

#### Use while loops when:

- The number of iterations depends on a condition
- You're implementing algorithms that need conditional termination
- You're creating infinite loops with break conditions

```python
# Good: Unknown number of iterations
while user_wants_to_continue():
    do_task()

# Good: Algorithm with conditional termination
while not solution_found() and attempts < max_attempts:
    try_solution()
    attempts += 1
```

### Optimization Tips

#### Avoid repeated function calls in loop conditions:

```python
# Inefficient: len() called every iteration
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    # ...

# Better: Store length once
length = len(my_list)
for i in range(length):
    # ...

# Best: Use direct iteration when possible
for item in my_list:
    # ...
```

#### Use appropriate data structures:

```python
# Slow: Checking membership in a list
large_list = list(range(10000))
for item in items_to_check:
    if item in large_list:  # O(n) operation
        # ...

# Fast: Checking membership in a set
large_set = set(range(10000))
for item in items_to_check:
    if item in large_set:  # O(1) operation
        # ...
```

#### Consider list comprehensions for simple transformations:

```python
# Standard loop
result = []
for x in range(100):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        result.append(x**2)

# List comprehension (often faster)
result = [x**2 for x in range(100) if x % 2 == 0]
```

## Common Loop Patterns and Use Cases

### Data Processing

#### Calculating statistics:

```python
# Finding min, max, sum, and average
numbers = [23, 45, 12, 67, 34, 89, 56]

total = 0
minimum = numbers[0]
maximum = numbers[0]

for num in numbers:
    total += num
    if num < minimum:
        minimum = num
    if num > maximum:
        maximum = num

average = total / len(numbers)

print(f"Sum: {total}")
print(f"Average: {average:.2f}")
print(f"Minimum: {minimum}")
print(f"Maximum: {maximum}")
```

#### Filtering data:

```python
# Processing a list of students
students = [
    {"name": "Alice", "grade": 85},
    {"name": "Bob", "grade": 92},
    {"name": "Charlie", "grade": 78},
    {"name": "Diana", "grade": 96}
]

# Find honor students (grade >= 90)
honor_students = []
for student in students:
    if student["grade"] >= 90:
        honor_students.append(student["name"])

print("Honor students:", honor_students)
# Output: Honor students: ['Bob', 'Diana']
```

### String Processing

#### Character analysis:

```python
text = "Hello, World! 123"
letters = 0
digits = 0
special = 0

for char in text:
    if char.isalpha():
        letters += 1
    elif char.isdigit():
        digits += 1
    else:
        special += 1

print(f"Letters: {letters}, Digits: {digits}, Special: {special}")
# Output: Letters: 10, Digits: 3, Special: 4
```

#### Word processing:

```python
sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words = sentence.split()

# Count word frequencies
word_count = {}
for word in words:
    if word in word_count:
        word_count[word] += 1
    else:
        word_count[word] = 1

print("Word frequencies:")
for word, count in word_count.items():
    print(f"{word}: {count}")
```

### File Processing

#### Reading and processing files:

```python
# Processing a CSV-like file
try:
    with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
        for line_number, line in enumerate(file, 1):
            line = line.strip()  # Remove whitespace
            if line:  # Skip empty lines
                parts = line.split(",")
                print(f"Line {line_number}: {parts}")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

### Pattern Generation

#### Creating patterns:

```python
# Number pyramid
rows = 5
for i in range(1, rows + 1):
    # Print spaces
    for j in range(rows - i):
        print(" ", end="")

    # Print numbers
    for k in range(1, i + 1):
        print(k, end="")

    print()  # New line

# Output:
#     1
#    12
#   123
#  1234
# 12345
```

### Game Development

#### Simple guessing game:

```python
import random

number = random.randint(1, 100)
attempts = 0
max_attempts = 10

print("Guess the number between 1 and 100!")

while attempts < max_attempts:
    try:
        guess = int(input(f"Attempt {attempts + 1}/{max_attempts}: "))
        attempts += 1

        if guess == number:
            print(f"Congratulations! You guessed it in {attempts} attempts!")
            break
        elif guess < number:
            print("Too low!")
        else:
            print("Too high!")

    except ValueError:
        print("Please enter a valid number!")

if attempts >= max_attempts:
    print(f"Game over! The number was {number}")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Choose Descriptive Variable Names

```python
# Bad
for i in data:
    print(i)

# Good
for student_name in student_names:
    print(student_name)

# Good
for index, value in enumerate(data):
    print(f"Index {index}: {value}")
```

### 2. Keep Loop Bodies Simple

```python
# Bad: Too much logic in loop
for item in items:
    if item.is_valid():
        if item.category == "electronics":
            if item.price > 100:
                item.apply_discount(0.1)
                item.add_to_cart()
                update_inventory(item)
                send_notification(item)

# Good: Extract complex logic into functions
def process_expensive_electronics(item):
    item.apply_discount(0.1)
    item.add_to_cart()
    update_inventory(item)
    send_notification(item)

for item in items:
    if item.is_valid() and item.category == "electronics" and item.price > 100:
        process_expensive_electronics(item)
```

### 3. Use Appropriate Loop Types

```python
# When you need both index and value, use enumerate()
for index, value in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f"{index}: {value}")

# When iterating over multiple sequences, use zip()
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")

# For simple transformations, consider comprehensions
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

### 4. Handle Edge Cases

```python
# Check for empty sequences
if not my_list:
    print("List is empty")
else:
    for item in my_list:
        process(item)

# Use get() for dictionaries to avoid KeyError
for key in my_dict:
    value = my_dict.get(key, "default_value")
    process(value)
```

### 5. Avoid Modifying Collections During Iteration

```python
# Bad: Modifying list while iterating
for item in my_list:
    if condition(item):
        my_list.remove(item)  # This can cause issues!

# Good: Create a new list or iterate backwards
my_list = [item for item in my_list if not condition(item)]

# Or iterate backwards when removing items
for i in range(len(my_list) - 1, -1, -1):
    if condition(my_list[i]):
        my_list.pop(i)
```

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. IndexError: list index out of range

```python
# Problem
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
for i in range(10):  # Range is too large!
    print(my_list[i])  # Error when i >= 3

# Solution
for i in range(len(my_list)):
    print(my_list[i])

# Or better yet
for item in my_list:
    print(item)
```

### 2. Infinite Loops

```python
# Problem
count = 0
while count < 10:
    print(count)
    # Forgot to increment count!

# Solution
count = 0
while count < 10:
    print(count)
    count += 1  # Don't forget this!
```

### 3. UnboundLocalError

```python
# Problem
total = 0

def calculate_sum(numbers):
    for num in numbers:
        total += num  # Error: can't modify global variable this way
    return total

# Solution 1: Use global keyword
total = 0

def calculate_sum(numbers):
    global total
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total

# Solution 2: Use local variable (better)
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total
```

### 4. Modifying List During Iteration

```python
# Problem
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    if num % 2 == 0:
        numbers.remove(num)  # This can skip elements!

# Solution
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]
```

### 5. Nested Loop Variable Confusion

```python
# Problem
for i in range(3):
    for i in range(3):  # Same variable name!
        print(i)  # Which 'i' is this?

# Solution
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(3):  # Different variable names
        print(f"i={i}, j={j}")
```
